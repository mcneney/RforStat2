# RforStat2

This repository contains notes to be read during short 
video presentations for students using R in a second course 
in statistics at SFU.

* Presentations are meant to be short and may go 
fast in places -- use the pause and replay on the 
video as necessary.
* When the topic of the presentation is a statistical 
method, it is assumed that the viewer has already 
studied the method  and is looking for a demonstration
of how to apply the method in R.

The order of presentations is:
